# WebSocket Real-time Implementation

## Overview
This Task Manager application includes comprehensive real-time WebSocket functionality using Flask-SocketIO, enabling instant updates for tasks, projects, comments, and user interactions across all connected clients.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Core WebSocket Infrastructure
- **Flask-SocketIO Integration**: Fully configured with CORS support and eventlet async mode
- **Authentication**: JWT token and session-based authentication for secure connections
- **Room Management**: Project-based rooms and user-specific channels
- **Connection Management**: Automatic user tracking and cleanup

### 2. Real-time Events

#### Task Management
- `task_created`: Broadcasts new task creation to project members
- `task_updated`: Real-time task updates with change tracking
- `task_status_changed`: Status change notifications with user assignments
- `task_deleted`: Task deletion notifications
- `task_assigned`: Task assignment notifications

#### Project Management  
- `project_updated`: Project information changes
- `project_member_added`: New member join notifications
- `project_stats_updated`: Real-time project statistics

#### Communication Features
- `comment_added`: New comment notifications on tasks
- `user_typing`: Typing indicators for task comments
- `notification`: Personal notifications for users

#### User Presence
- `user_connected`/`user_disconnected`: User presence tracking
- `online_users`: Get list of currently online project members
- `ping`/`pong`: Connection keepalive mechanism

### 3. Enhanced Features

#### Broadcasting Utilities (`broadcast_utils.py`)
- Task assignment notifications
- Project member management
- Due date reminders
- Project statistics updates
- Bulk operation broadcasts
- System announcements

#### Client Example (`websocket_client_example.py`)
- Complete Python client implementation
- Event handling demonstrations
- Connection management
- Authentication examples

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
```
app/
├── __init__.py              # SocketIO initialization
├── websocket/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── events.py           # Main event handlers
│   └── broadcast_utils.py  # Broadcasting utilities
├── app_socketio.py         # Main application with SocketIO
└── websocket_client_example.py # Client implementation example
```

### Key Components

#### 1. SocketIO Initialization (`app/__init__.py`)
```python
from flask_socketio import SocketIO
socketio = SocketIO()

# In create_app():
socketio.init_app(
    app,
    cors_allowed_origins=['http://localhost:3000', 'http://127.0.0.1:3000'],
    async_mode='eventlet',
    logger=True,
    engineio_logger=True
)
```

#### 2. Authentication System
- JWT token authentication via query parameters
- Session-based fallback authentication
- Automatic disconnection for unauthorized users
- User context tracking throughout connection lifecycle

#### 3. Room Management
- **Project Rooms**: `project_{project_id}` for project-specific broadcasts
- **User Rooms**: `user_{user_id}` for personal notifications
- Automatic room joining based on project membership
- Cleanup on disconnection

### Event Flow Examples

#### Task Creation Flow
1. API endpoint creates task
2. `emit_task_created()` utility function called
3. Event broadcasted to `project_{project_id}` room
4. All project members receive real-time update
5. Assigned user receives personal notification

#### User Connection Flow
1. User connects with authentication
2. User joins personal room (`user_{user_id}`)
3. User auto-joins all project rooms they're member of
4. Connection broadcasted to project rooms
5. User state tracked in `connected_users` dictionary

## Usage Examples

### Frontend Integration (JavaScript)
```javascript
import io from 'socket.io-client';

const socket = io('http://localhost:5000', {
    auth: { token: jwt_token }
});

// Listen for task updates
socket.on('task_created', (data) => {
    console.log('New task:', data.task);
    // Update UI
});

// Join project room
socket.emit('join_project', { project_id: 1 });

// Send typing indicator
socket.emit('user_typing', { task_id: 1, is_typing: true });
```

### Python Client Usage
```python
from websocket_client_example import TaskManagerWebSocketClient

client = TaskManagerWebSocketClient(
    server_url='http://localhost:5000',
    token='your_jwt_token'
)

if client.connect():
    client.join_project(1)
    client.wait()  # Listen for events
```

## API Integration Points

### Broadcasting from API Endpoints
```python
from app.websocket.events import emit_task_created, emit_task_updated
from app.websocket.broadcast_utils import broadcast_task_assignment

# In API endpoint after task creation
emit_task_created(task, current_user)

# For task assignments
broadcast_task_assignment(task, assigned_user, current_user)
```

## Performance Considerations

1. **Connection Pooling**: Uses eventlet for efficient connection handling
2. **Room Management**: Efficient room-based broadcasting reduces unnecessary traffic
3. **Authentication Caching**: User authentication cached during connection
4. **Cleanup Mechanisms**: Automatic cleanup of disconnected users and rooms
5. **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

## Security Features

1. **Authentication Required**: All connections must be authenticated
2. **Project Access Control**: Users only receive updates for projects they're members of
3. **CORS Configuration**: Restricted to allowed origins
4. **Token Validation**: JWT tokens validated on each sensitive operation
5. **Input Validation**: All incoming event data validated

## Monitoring and Health Checks

### Health Check Endpoints
- `/health`: General application health including WebSocket status
- `/websocket/status`: Specific WebSocket connection statistics

### Logging
- Connection/disconnection events
- Event broadcasting
- Error conditions
- Performance metrics

## Deployment Notes

1. **Dependencies**: Requires `eventlet` for optimal performance
2. **Redis**: Can be configured for scaling across multiple instances
3. **Load Balancing**: Supports sticky sessions for WebSocket connections
4. **Environment Variables**: Configure CORS origins for production

This implementation provides a robust foundation for real-time collaboration features in the Task Manager application, enabling seamless user experiences with instant updates and notifications.
